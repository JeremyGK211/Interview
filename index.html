			<h3>Why do you want to be a designer?</h3>
			<p>
			I want to be a graphic designer because I want to used my creative skills in my everyday life. I love
			the idea of working with different kinds of clients and also think that being a graphic designer can
			provide me with everyday problems and challenges that I will enjoy solving.</p>

			<h3>What makes you nervous about becoming a designer?</h3>
			<p>
			What makes me nervous is that graphic design is a very broad term. There are a lot of different
			fields and directions of which I can enter, and as of now I am not 100% positive where I will end up
			in the field.</p>

			<h3>What are some areas of opportunity to work on?</h3>
			<p>
			Some areas that I need to work on are my technical skills in many of the adobe programs. Though I
			have gotten much better, I still find that there are times when I have a good idea, but simply am
			limited by my skills in these programs. </p>

			<h3>What are the roles and responsibilities of a graphic designer in society?</h3>
			<p>
			In my opinion a graphic designer has a very large roll in society. Graphic Designers control almost
			everything we see and therefore can influence the opinion and attitudes of our consumers. In my
			opinion society as a whole can be shaped and formed through graphic designers. </p>

			<h3>When/where/why are you at your most creative/productive?</h3>
			<p>
			I am at my most creative in the morning, after I have done a workout. I am most productive when I am out
			of the house and at school or a coffee shop to do work. This is because I have the most energy in the
			morning after I have worked out. My home for me is my place of rest, and I try not to do any work at home.
			Instead I get out of the house and work elsewhere.  </p>
